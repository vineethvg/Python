Sequence algorithms

1) Bit map algorithms - fuzzy algorithm that determines if strings are approximately equal
2) String metrics - computes a similarity or dissimilarity (distance) score between two pairs of text strings
3) Hamming distance - sum number of positions which are different
4) Jaroâ€“Winkler distance - is a measure of similarity between two strings
